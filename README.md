## What Is This?

The Sustainable Visibility Toolkit is a comprehensive marketing framework designed specifically for independent practitioners, small studios, and community-based businesses who want to build sustainable practices **without burning out or breaking the bank**.

Unlike generic marketing advice that assumes you have 20 hours per week and a big budget, this toolkit is built for:
- **5 hours per week** of marketing effort
- **Minimal or zero ad spend**
- **Community-first values**
- **Long-term sustainability over growth-at-all-costs**

✅ **Mental health professionals** - therapists, counselors, coaches  
✅ **Creative professionals** - photographers, designers, artists  
✅ **Professional services** - bookkeepers, consultants, virtual assistants
