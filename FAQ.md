# Frequently Asked Questions
## Sustainable Visibility Toolkit

---

## General Questions

### Is this really free?
**Yes, completely free forever.** No email capture, no upsells, no hidden costs, no "freemium" model. It's licensed under Creative Commons (CC BY-SA 4.0), which means it must always stay free and open.

### Why did you make this free?
From the creator: "I don't want to gatekeep this information anymore. I want more people to be able to do this. Community health matters more than monetizing every resource."

This toolkit is built on the philosophy that **visibility is community care**—when small businesses thrive, communities thrive.

### Can I really use this without paying anything?
Absolutely. Download it, implement it, share it. No strings attached.

### What if I want to support this work?
If the toolkit helps your practice and you have the resources, you can [support ongoing updates on Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/danieve). But it's always optional—this will never be behind a paywall.

## Using the Toolkit

### Will this work for my specific industry?
The frameworks are tested across multiple industries:
- ✅ Wellness (massage, acupuncture, bodywork)
- ✅ Mental health (therapy, counseling, coaching)
- ✅ Creative services (photography, design)
- ✅ Professional services (bookkeeping, consulting)
- ✅ Local retail and service businesses

**If you're an independent practitioner or small business building community relationships, this will work.**

Use the AI prompts throughout to customize for your specific niche.

### I'm not tech-savvy. Can I still use this?
Yes! The toolkit is written in plain language with step-by-step guidance. The most "technical" thing you'll do is use AI prompts (copy-paste ready).

If you can:
- Send emails
- Post on social media
- Use Google Docs

Then you can implement this toolkit.

### How long will this take to implement?
**Initial setup:** 2-3 hours for Quick Wins  
**Ongoing:** 5 hours per week (the whole point!)

The Five-Hour Rhythm Week is designed to be sustainable for solo practitioners who don't have a marketing team.

### Do I need to follow this exactly?
No! Think of it as a menu. Take what fits your situation and leave the rest. The self-assessment helps you find your starting point.

### Can I skip the sections that don't apply to me?
Absolutely. Not everyone needs events, not everyone needs partnerships, not everyone needs community managers. Use what serves you.

## About the Research

### Are these statistics real?
Yes. Every major ROI claim is backed by research from:
- Wharton Business School
- Bain & Company
- Harvard Business Review  
- BrightLocal (annual surveys of 1,100+ consumers)
- McKinsey
- And 15+ other authoritative sources

All citations are included with links in the References section.

### Will these numbers work for me?
The statistics represent **industry averages and typical ranges**—not guarantees. Your results will vary based on:
- Your industry
- Your market size
- Your competition
- Your consistency
- Your starting point

Use them as directional guidance, not precise predictions. **Track your own baseline and measure your own improvement.**

### Are the statistics up to date?
Yes. Research is primarily from 2023-2025, with some foundational studies from earlier years that remain relevant (like Bain & Company's retention research).

The toolkit is reviewed annually for updated statistics.

### Can I trust research from 2020-2023?
Foundational principles (like customer retention impact or referral effectiveness) don't change dramatically year-to-year. 

Recent data (2023-2025) is prioritized for consumer behavior stats (like review reading habits) which do evolve.

## Sharing & Using

### Can I share this with colleagues?
Please do! That's the whole point. Share the GitHub link freely.

### Can I use this with my clients?
Yes, **with attribution**. You can:
- ✅ Teach workshops based on it (credit the source)
- ✅ Use it as a client resource (credit the source)
- ✅ Adapt sections for your coaching programs (credit + share-alike)
- ✅ Reference frameworks in your consulting (credit the source)

**You cannot:**
- ❌ Sell it as your own proprietary material
- ❌ Remove the attribution to Danielle Eve
- ❌ Make adaptations proprietary (must remain open)

See the LICENSE file for full details.

### Can I translate this to another language?
Yes! Translations are encouraged. Requirements:
- Maintain attribution
- Use same CC BY-SA license
- Notify via GitHub issue so we can link to it

### Can I create an industry-specific version?
Yes! For example:
- "Wellness Edition"
- "Therapist's Guide"
- "Creative Services Version"

Requirements:
- Credit the original
- Use CC BY-SA license
- Ideally, contribute back to the main toolkit so everyone benefits

### Can I make a course or book based on this?
Under CC BY-SA:
- ✅ Yes, you can create derivative works
- ✅ You must credit the original
- ✅ Your derivative must also be CC BY-SA (free and open)
- ❌ You cannot make it proprietary

So you can't create a $500 course using this as the sole foundation, but you could create a free course or offer facilitation services around it.

## Technical Questions

### What's a GitHub repository?
Think of it like a public Google Drive folder where:
- Documents are version-controlled (you can see history)
- People can suggest improvements
- Anyone can download the latest version
- It's free to host

You don't need to understand GitHub to download and use the toolkit. Just click the green "Code" button → "Download ZIP."

### What does "fork" mean?
Making your own copy of the repository to work on. Like "Save As" for a document. Your fork is yours to modify, but you should credit the original.

### What's a pull request?
A suggested change to the original. You propose an edit, and the maintainer (me) can accept or decline it. It's how open-source collaboration works.

### Why markdown (.md) format?
Markdown is:
- Simple text format
- Easy to read and edit
- Works on any device
- Converts easily to PDF, Word, HTML
- Standard for GitHub documentation

You can open .md files in any text editor, or view them nicely formatted on GitHub.

### Can I convert this to PDF?
Yes! Several ways:
1. Use GitHub's print function → Save as PDF
2. Use Pandoc (free tool) to convert markdown to PDF
3. Copy into Google Docs and export
4. Use online markdown-to-PDF converters

## Implementation Questions

### I started but got overwhelmed. What do I do?
1. **Go back to the Quick Wins section** - just do those 5 things
2. **Pick ONE framework** to focus on this quarter
3. **Lower your expectations** - 2 hours/week is better than quitting
4. **Ask for help** - post in the GitHub issues

Remember: This toolkit took a decade to develop. You don't need to implement it all in a week.

### I don't have time for 5 hours per week. Now what?
Try this instead:
- **2 hours/week:** Quick Wins + monthly metrics check
- **1 hour/week:** Just the client touchpoints from Thursday's rhythm
- **30 min/week:** Review requests + partner thank-yous

**Something is better than nothing.** Adjust to your capacity.

### I tried something and it didn't work. Did I do it wrong?
Not necessarily. Marketing is contextual. What works in one market or industry might not work in another. 

Try:
1. Give it 90 days (most things need time)
2. Check your execution (did you follow the guidance?)
3. Adjust for your context
4. Share what happened (GitHub issue) - helps improve the toolkit

### None of my clients are leaving reviews. Why?
Common reasons:
- Not asking at the right time (ask 24-48 hours after, not immediately)
- Not making it easy enough (send direct link to review page)
- Not asking enough (need automated system)
- Your timing is off (review request during bad experience)

See Section 5: Tier 2 (Proof) for detailed review strategies.

### I have too many clients already. Is this still useful?
Yes! Sections 10 (Events), 11 (Metrics), 12 (Pricing), and Appendix F (Scaling) are specifically for established practices.

When you're at capacity:
- Raise prices
- Improve retention (cheaper than finding new clients)
- Add team members
- Create group offerings

### How do I report an error?
1. Go to the GitHub repository
2. Click "Issues" tab
3. Click "New Issue"

Yes! We'd love to hear it. Options:
- Open a GitHub issue labeled "case-study"
- Email directly
- Tag on social media

Success stories help improve the toolkit and inspire others.

### Will you add [specific feature]?
Maybe! Open an issue explaining:
- What you'd like added
- Why it would be useful
- How it fits with existing frameworks

Can't promise everything will be added, but all suggestions are considered.

## Philosophical Questions

### Why give this away instead of charging for it?
**From the creator:**

"I don't want to spend a lot of time running a products business. I want to make money doing other things. I just want people to have access to this. I want more people to be able to do this."

The free/open model:
- Removes friction (more people use it)
- Creates network effects (more sharing)
- Builds real community (contributors feel ownership)
- Stays true to values (community over commodity)

### Isn't free content less valuable?
**Quality ≠ Price**

This toolkit has:
- 20+ research citations from top institutions
- 10+ years of field testing
- Comprehensive frameworks
- Professional-grade content

It's free because **access matters more than gatekeeping**. The value is in the implementation, not the download.

### How do you make money then?
The creator makes money through other services and offerings. This toolkit builds authority and goodwill, which creates opportunities naturally.

Plus: some people voluntarily support via Ko-fi, which helps maintain and improve the resource.

### What's the long-term plan?
**Short-term:**
- Community contributions
- Annual research updates
- Industry-specific adaptations
- Translation to other languages

**Long-term:**
- Possibly: workshops, cohorts, facilitation (based on demand)
- Possibly: certification program for consultants using the framework
- Definitely: Keeping it free and open forever
